# Nursing Callout Quickstart
This repository contains two versions of project files:
1. A version of the project written in Python
2. A version of the project written (mostly) in SQL

This project is intended to be run from within a Databricks Spark Context. Some code features (e.g., dbutils) are not supported via Spark Connect so unless you are running this from within a managed Databricks environment, your mileage may vary.

This manual cover how to get started both with the Python and SQL versions of the project. Please pick one or the other to get started.

If you need help getting this repo into your managed Databricks environment, please refer to [these docs](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html):
